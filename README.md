# Install-PSIO-on-PSone

![image](images/PSonePSIO.png)

This project allows you to add a **Parallel port** to the **PSone** in order to use a Cybdyn Systems's PSIO Cartridge by preserving also the CD-ROM drive. The parallel port must be sourced from a donor phat PS1 (this is the only drawback). The utility of this mod is to avoid to solder a PSIO cartdridge directly inside the console so if you have also a phat PSIO ready PS1 you can use PSIO on both. PSIO cartdridge can be purchased from the [Cybdyn Systems online store](https://psio.cybdyn-systems.com.au/store/psio-cartridge/). This is the only way to play your PS1 games from an SD card preserving your CD-ROM drive.

You alone accept all risk since you are 100% liable for damage to yourself or your property. This is an unofficial mod so again, try this by knowing the risks.**


## Repo overview

The production file can be found on PCWay at this link. An overwiev of the boards is shown in the following image.

So you have 3 PCBs directly into one file. I suggest you to produce PCBs with 0.8 mm thickness. To save money you can produce them in HASL but soldering the FPC connectors can be harder than the ENIG surface finish. So the choice is up to you.

## Instructions

The installation can be summarized as shown in the following image.

**I have used the PSone model A** but it should be ok also for model B (if someone confirm this to me I will update this part of the description).
The detailed installation is shown in the [setup video](https://youtu.be/x9w5lpTidZ8)

**How cut the double row PIN headers in order to have single row headers will be shown in a new video asap**.

## Instructions

The "PSIO_PSone_gaskets.stl" file can be 3D printed. It contains the gaskets that you can use to refine the visible cutted parts of the shell.
## Credits
  - TZMVX that shared in the past the way to wire a PSIO cartdridge inside the PSone. So my project started from it. I cannot find this project so if someone indicate me whois TZMVX I can give him/her proper credits.
  - [Cybdyn Systems](https://psio.cybdyn-systems.com.au/store/psio-cartridge/) that practically allowed me on Discord to share this project.

## Support VIS projects

I have several stuffs in mind, but since developing these things has a high cost in materials and prototypes, a little [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=LSQK3VE8Y6EE6) donation is appreciated.
